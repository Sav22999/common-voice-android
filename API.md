API: Application Programming Interface

The app, in addition to the Common Voice API (official of Mozilla), use also "CV Android" API (better "Saverio Morelli API").

In this file there will be listed just the second one.

First of all you need to know that, all this API doesn't collect your personal information, like *name*, *last name*, *email*, *age*.

Please, consider to **don't** insert useless data, because these are just to understand how many users use the app and how use it.

## App statistics

### GET

#### Request

To get app statistics you need to do a `GET request` to https://www.saveriomorelli.com/api/common-voice-android/v2/app-statistics/.

If you don't insert any parameters, the system will return all statistics (of the day) about all languages.

You can specify these parameters:

| Key        | Value                       | Required   | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `language` | `all` or the language code* | `optional` | *the language code have to be in the "Common Voice style". For example, if you want to get statistics for the Italian language you need to specify the code `it`.<br />If you don't specify anything, the system will return to you statistics of all languages. |

#### Response

The system return a `JSON` data, that contains data like this:

`{"language":{"user":N1,"logged:"M1},"language2":{"user":N2,"logged":M2}}`, where `language` and `language2` are the language codes, `N1`, `N2`, `M1`, `M2` are integers.

So, for each language this are the information:

| Key      | Value     | Explanation                                                  |
